# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN-architecture
In this project, I have implemented a handwritten digit recognition app using the MNIST
dataset - which is one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero
to nine and also 10,000 images for testing. The MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. On
the other hand the handwritten digit images are represented as a 28x28 matrix where each cell
contains grayscale pixel value. I used a special type of deep neural network that is Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). In the end, I built a GUI in which one can draw the digit and
recognize it straight away. It was done to explore the CNN architecture and the tkinter library
for gui purposes.
