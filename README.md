# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN-architecture
In this project, I am going to implement a handwritten digit recognition app using the MNIST dataset which is probably one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value. I will be using a special type of deep neural network that is Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). In the end, I am going to build a GUI in which you can draw the digit and recognize it straight away.
